# Decision criteria

Use this checklist to decide if a documentation task is a good fit for LLM automation.

## 1) Source of truth

- Do we have a **trusted source** (spec, code, API contract, approved docs)?
- Can we enforce **citation** or traceability back to that source?

## 2) Risk and blast radius

- What happens if the output is wrong?
- Who is harmed (customer, support, compliance, security)?

## 3) Human review lane

- Who reviews (writer, engineer, PM)?
- What is the definition of “done” for that output?

## 4) Evaluation readiness

- Can we define a rubric and test cases?
- Can we measure improvements over time?
