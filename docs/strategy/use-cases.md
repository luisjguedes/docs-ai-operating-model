# Use-case catalog

This is an example catalog. In practice, you keep it short, prioritized, and measurable.

## High-impact, low-risk (start here)

- **Release notes drafting** from structured inputs (tickets/PRs)  
- **Style and clarity rewrites** with strict constraints  
- **Content consistency checks** (terminology, tone, patterns)

## Medium-risk (needs tighter guardrails)

- **Troubleshooting assistants** (RAG + citations + refusal behavior)  
- **API reference enrichment** (OpenAPI → human narrative + examples)

## High-risk (avoid unless you can fully govern it)

- Generating **authoritative product behavior** without a trusted source
- Summaries that can be mistaken for **contracts** or **legal commitments**
