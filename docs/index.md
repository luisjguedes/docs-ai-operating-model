# Docs AI Operating Model

This site is a **reference implementation** for building and governing **AI-assisted documentation** in a **docs-as-code** environment.

If you are evaluating a documentation leader or senior technical writer, this repository is meant to answer:

- Can this person **design an operating model**, not just write pages?
- Can they build **quality gates** and **measurement** around content?
- Can they integrate **LLMs responsibly** (governance, evaluation, safety)?
- Can they work effectively in a **remote-first**, async, cross-functional environment?

> All examples are fictitious and created for portfolio purposes.

## Recommended path

1. **Start here** → what to read and why  
2. **Strategy** → what to automate, and what not to  
3. **Governance** → risk, policy, review lanes  
4. **PromptOps** → prompts as code + versioning  
5. **Evaluation** → how quality is defined and tested  
6. **Implementation** → CI gates + reference pipeline
