# Human review lanes

A practical operating model defines **who signs off** and **what “good” means**.

## Lane A — Low risk (writer review)

Examples:
- grammar fixes
- consistency checks
- structure improvements

**Definition of done:** passes style checks + writer approval.

## Lane B — Medium risk (writer + SME)

Examples:
- troubleshooting flow improvements
- API example rewrites

**Definition of done:** passes evaluation + SME approval.

## Lane C — High risk (writer + SME + product/legal)

Examples:
- content with contractual or compliance implications

**Definition of done:** formal approval + audit trail.
